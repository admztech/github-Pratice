# git init command:

when we create the new folder or project in our local system. that is not automatically a Git repository.
It is just regular folder.

To make it git respository use the command "git init". This is initializes that new created folder. we navigate folder and
write the "git init command" and press enter. Now git will used to track changes.

Once the respository is initialized, you can use commond like .

- git add
- git commit
- git push

The git init make the folder or respository Git respository locally on your system. not on the
Github.
How can to push the folder or Project onto GitHub remotally. because is only on our local system.

# git remote add origin <link>

how can we new resposity to push onto the GetHub account.
To add the respository onto github we need to set new repositor on our GitHub account that respository is empty we did not
add any file init. and copy that repository link . We set that respository link as the remote using the "git remote add origin<link>
git remote add origin <link>.
