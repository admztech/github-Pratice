# git init command:

when we create the new folder or project in our local system. that is not automatically a Git repository.
It is just regular folder.

To make it git respository use the command "git init". This is initializes that new created folder. we navigate folder and
write the "git init command" and press enter. Now git will used to track changes.

Once the respository is initialized, you can use commond like .

- git add
- git commit
- git push

The git init make the folder or respository Git respository locally on your system. not on the
Github.

# git remote add origin <link>
